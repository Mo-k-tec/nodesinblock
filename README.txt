Overview:
--------
Nodes in block makes it possible to add nodes into a block. A number of configurable 
blocks are generated which you can assign to a region. Visibility settings of this 
block are automatically set to 'Show on only the listed pages'. On the node content form,
you define the weight and visibility per node thus making it easier for content administration
as all your content is now in the same place, by either choosing the exact content type from
the administration screen or from the extra overview screen generated by this module.
With this module, you don't have to explain your customers how blocks work but is still 
able to decide on which pages content must be rendered.

Installation:
-------------
1. Place this module directory in your modules folder 
   (this will usually be "sites/all/modules/").
2. Go to "administer -> build -> modules" and enable the module.

Configuration:
--------------
Go to "administer -> settings -> nodesinblock" 

Select how many blocks you want and which content types will benefit from this feature. 
After submitting this setting, two fieldsets will become available after clicking the submit
button where you can change the names of the block and associate content types per block.
After that, go to admin/build/block and assign one or more blocks to a region.

That's it, visibility paths are set on the node content form.

Theming
-------
Every node in the block can be rendered as a teaser or page. An extra property is also added to 
the node object which you can use in your node template file.

<?php
// node.tpl.php
if (isset($node->nodesinblock)) {
  // Theming for node in block
}
else {
  // Normal theming
}
?>
